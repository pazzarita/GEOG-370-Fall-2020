<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Tools </h1>
<h2>Paige Azzarita</h2>
<h3>In this project, I wanted to answer the question: "Is Kudzu going to take over the land area of Georgia?" Kudzu is an invasive species from Asia that is one of the fastest growing plant species in the United States. Its rapid growth in the US climate has made it one of the more harmful invasive plant species, and is a major threat to forest areas. In this map, I used point data of Kudzu populations in the US, and isolated it to points in Georgia using the intersect function. I then identified which areas were most likely to grow and which were least likely to grow by creating two sets of intersects, one with high quality soil areas, and one wth urban areas. I then added a buffer of 365 feet to the points in high soil areas, since Kudzu can grow up to one foot per day, to see how the territory could be expected to grow over the course of a year.  </h3>
